# TaskSync - Task Management Web Application

TaskSync is a full-stack web application designed to streamline project and task management with real-time collaboration features. Built with **React** on the frontend and **Laravel** on the backend, this project demonstrates proficiency in modern web development, including RESTful APIs, real-time communication, and role-based access control. It was created to enhance my portfolio by showcasing practical, user-focused solutions.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure signup and login using Laravel Sanctum.
- **Dashboard**: Role-based views for project creators (full project overview) and employees (assigned tasks only).
- **Project Management**: Create, edit, and delete projects; assign tasks and subtasks with supervisors and employees.
- **Connection System**: LinkedIn-like connections required before assigning roles (e.g., task supervisors, employees).
- **Task Hierarchy**: Projects contain tasks, and tasks contain subtasks, assignable to connected team members.
- **Real-Time Chat**: Automatic main chat channel per project and subchannels per task, powered by Pusher and Laravel Echo.
- **Privacy**: Employees only see projects and channels theyâ€™re part of; strict role-based permissions.
